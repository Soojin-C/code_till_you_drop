# Team: code_till_you_drop
APCS Lab 02: All Hands on Deque!
  
# Deque methods(in order of priority for implementation)
`1) size()`  
`2) addFirst()`  
`3) addLast()`    
`4) removeFirst()`    
`5) removeLast()`    
`6) peekFront()`    
`7) peekLast()`    

# Architecture Options
  Our team has opted to use the DLLNode(doubly linked list) because it offers a two way linkage. Double-ended queue means that one can enqueue and dequeue from both ends, which is why DLLNodes make the most sense. The node structure points both ways, allowing for a more logical implementation for Deque.
